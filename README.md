# SDFs
Experimenting with SDFs - Built on NQAE

## Information on the Previous Iterations of this Project:
[Part 1: Basic bitcrush dithering](https://jbaker.graphics/writings/sdf1.html)
[Part 2: more experiments with SDF techniques and dithering in different color spaces](https://jbaker.graphics/writings/sdf2.html)

### Plans for part 3:
- dithering in even more color spaces
- soft shadows
- multisampling the initial raymarching result
- experimenting with distance estimated fractals
- a scheme for refractive objects (lens shapes)
- cycled blue noise dithering using the golden ratio trick
