- Stuff from Voraldo13
	- unordered maps of OpenGL resources
	- trident, but that's pretty specific to Voraldo... fuck it, might as well
		- add multisampling to the rendering, smooth edges

- Convert back to using GLEW for OpenGL function loading
	- hopefully will help to fix issues using GL3W on the new machine
