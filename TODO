- Stuff from Voraldo13
	- trident, but that's pretty specific to Voraldo... fuck it, might as well
		- add multisampling to the rendering, smooth edges
	- add bayer header with the bayer patterns from Voraldo13

- Convert back to using GLEW for OpenGL function loading
	- hopefully will help to fix issues using GL3W on the new machine
