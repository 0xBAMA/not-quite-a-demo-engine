- NQADE

	- Converting NQADE/jbDE to Vulkan - a little further out
		- Hardware Raytracing Experimentation, not possible with OpenGL

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- jbDE - WIP - Will replace NQADE

	- Adding some kind of thing where projects inherit from a base engine class
		- This will be a new engine, jbDE, the jb Demo Engine - but much carried forward from NQADE
			- All projects will be kept in the same repo, build script generates separate executables

	- Need to work on figuring out how projects will inherit from the base engine class

	- Once I get to that point, I will be able to maintain the projects automagically
		- Vertexture
		- SoftBodies
		- Voraldo
		- Siren
		- SDFs SDF validation tool for the DEC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Plans for next version of Voraldo ( Voraldo14 )

	- Operation Scripting and Logging
		- Logging needs seeding for RNG resources so scripting operations can be deterministic
		- Scripting needs to be able to control everything
			- Rendering parameters
				- Camera type, position, orientation
			- drawing operations
			- lighting operations

	- Spaceship Generator reimpl
		- Using new glyph and palette resources
		- Palette Options
			- simple palette from the lospec set
			- interpolated lospec set
			- iq-style sinusoid palettes
			- simple gradients
			- heatmap gradient
			- color temperature sweep

	- Render mode control
		- different cameras

	- Stuff from Voraldo13
		- different types of screenshot utilities ( lower priority )
			- accumulator
			- after postprocessing
			- directly from framebuffer

	- Normal vectors derived from alpha channel gradient ( similar to SDF normal )

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Siren Plans
	- Need to refit refraction, try this with explicit primitives

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- DEC plans ( website )
	- Operators section
	- 2D section

- Articles - Keeping up with projects as they happen, so they don't pile up again
	- currently none pending

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Some More Concrete Future Project Ideas

	- Reimplementation of the VIVS V8 Engine Animation as a Raymarching Demo ( likely on Shadertoy )

	- Visible Human Data Resampling - MIP chain + 3d sampling
		- Generate mip chain from original data, allow for arbitrary resampling at arbitrary scales

	- SoftBodies2
		- Support larger models - currently nowhere near the cap on the current single thread impl
			- I think it will work well on the GPU
		- I want to change the way the tension / compression coloring is done
			- Instead of just hard cut red to blue, I want to fade, through white at neutral

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Other More Vague Future Project Ideas

	- More Advanced Optics Simulation
		- need to look at explicit primitives for lens shapes, SDF lens shapes are problematic

	- 3D version of Physarum sim
		- I think there's a lot more cool stuff I can do with the physarum thing

	- Fluid Simulation

	- Experimenting with TinyGLTF and loading of the Intel Sponza models
		- Got to try shadowmapping at some point
		- Normal mapping is cool as shit

	- Engine and Suspension Simulation - voxels for center of mass calculation

	- Glitch effects using the bitfontCore2 bit masks

	- Tree growing stuff - I have some good links on my ideas discord server - bring those over
