@brief Plugin manager

Manages loading, instancing and unloading plugins. See @ref plugin-management
for a high-level introduction.

@section PluginManager-Manager-paths Plugin directories

Plugins are searched in the following directories, in order:

1.  If a non-empty `pluginDirectory` was passed to the @ref Manager(std::string)
    constructor, plugins are searched there.
2.  Otherwise, it's expected that given plugin interface defined
    @ref AbstractPlugin::pluginSearchPaths(). The search goes through the
    entries and stops once an existing directory is found.

In both cases the path of @ref Utility::Directory::executableLocation() is
prepended to relative paths before testing. The matching directory is then
saved and available through @ref pluginDirectory().

Besides the above, it's possible to call @ref load() with a concrete path to a
dynamic module file to load a plugin from outside of the plugin directory. The
file is expected to be accompanied by its corresponding `*.conf` metadata file
(unless overriden in the plugin interface using
@ref AbstractPlugin::pluginMetadataSuffix())
and no plugin with the same name is expected to be loaded at the same time. If
loading succeeds, the module is exposed through the API under its basename
(excluding extension).

@section PluginManager-Manager-reload Plugin loading, instantiation and unloading

A plugin is loaded by calling @ref load() with given plugin name or alias.
After that, you can get one or more instances using @ref instantiate(). For
convenience, @ref loadAndInstantiate() combines these two operations into one.

Plugin is unloaded either by calling @ref unload() or on plugin manager
destruction. By default, all active plugin instances have to be deleted before
a plugin can be unloaded. For hot reloading and other specific use cases it's
possible to unload a plugin that still has active instances. For that to work,
@ref AbstractPlugin::canBeDeleted() has to return @cpp true @ce for all active
instances, otherwise @ref unload() returns @ref LoadState::Used. Moreover, in
order to avoid double-free issues, you have to call
@ref Containers::Pointer::release() "release()" on all @ref Containers::Pointer
instances returned from @ref Manager::instantiate() or
@ref Manager::loadAndInstantiate().

@section PluginManager-Manager-data Plugin-specific data and configuration

Besides the API provided by a particular plugin interface after given plugin is
instantiated, plugins can also define various additional metadata that can be
accessed even if the plugin is not loaded. That can be used for example to
provide extra information to users in a plugin listing UI. Plugin-specific data
can be accessed via @ref PluginMetadata::data() through either @ref metadata()
or @ref AbstractPlugin::metadata().

In order to make it possible to configure behavior of specific plugins on top
of what the general plugin interface provides, the
@ref AbstractPlugin::configuration() function provides read-write access to
a configuration specific to a particular plugin instance. This can be used for
example to adjust various quality/speed properties of a JPEG image conversion
plugin that wouldn't be otherwise available in a general image converter plugin
API.

See @ref PluginMetadata for detailed description of the plugin metadata file.

@section PluginManager-Manager-dependencies Plugin dependencies

Plugins can depend on each other by listing then in the metadata file, as
described in the @ref PluginMetadata class documentation. From the user
point-of-view the dependency handling is completely transparent --- loading a
plugin will also load all its dependencies, fail if some dependencies can't be
found, and disallow the plugin from being unloaded when some other still needs
it.

A special (and rarer) case is inter-manager dependencies. By default, to avoid
shared mutable global state, plugin manager instances don't know about each
other, so if a plugin depends on another from a different interface, you need
to instantiate a manager for the other interface and register it with the
original manager using @ref registerExternalManager().

@section PluginManager-Manager-multiple-instances Multiple instances of the same manager

It's possible to have more than one instance of the same manager as well as
loading and instantiating the same plugin in more than one manager at the same
time. For static plugins there's no reason this could work, for dynamic both
the Unix @m_class{m-doc-external} [dlopen()](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html)
and Windows @m_class{m-doc-external} [LoadLibrary()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryw)
load the library only once and maintain reference count to ensure it's unloaded
only after it's not needed anymore. The only way you may run into problem is by
loading the same plugin binary twice under different filenames, causing the
loader to have symbol conflicts, violating ODR.

@section PluginManager-Manager-multithreading Thread safety

Static plugins register themselves into a global storage. If done implicitly,
the registration is executed before entering @cpp main() @ce and thus serially.
If done explicitly via @ref CORRADE_PLUGIN_IMPORT() / @ref CORRADE_PLUGIN_EJECT(),
these macros *have to* be called from a single thread or externally guarded to
avoid data races.

On the other hand, all other functionality only reads from the global storage
and thus is thread-safe.
