/**
@brief String
@m_since_latest

A lightweight non-templated alternative to @ref std::string with support for
custom deleters. Owning counterpart to @ref BasicStringView "StringView".

@section Containers-String-usage Usage

It's recommended to prefer using @ref BasicStringView "StringView" and in most
cases, and only create a @ref String instance if you need to extend lifetime of
the data or mutate it. The @ref String is implicitly convertible from C string
literals, but the designated way to instantiate a string is using the
@link operator""_s() @endlink literal. While both expressions are *mostly*
equivalent, the implicit conversion has some runtime impact due to
@ref std::strlen(), and it won't preserve zero bytes inside the string:

@snippet Containers.cpp String-literal-null

@ref String instances are implicitly convertible from and to
(mutable) @ref BasicStringView "StringView", all instances (including an empty
string) are guaranteed to be null-terminated, which means a conversion to
@ref BasicStringView "StringView" will always have
@ref StringViewFlag::NullTerminated set.

As with @ref BasicStringView "StringView", the class is implicitly convertible
to @ref ArrayView. In addition it's also move-convertible to @ref Array, transferring the ownership of the internal data array to it. Ownership transfer
in the other direction is not provided because it's not possible to implicitly
guarantee null termination of the input @ref Array --- use the explicit
@ref String(char*, std::size_t, Deleter) constructor together with
@ref Array::release() in that case.

@section Containers-String-sso Small string optimization

The class stores data size, data pointer and a deleter pointer, which is 24
bytes on 64-bit platforms (and 12 bytes on 32-bit). To avoid allocations for
small strings, small strings up to 22 bytes on 64-bit (23 including the null
terminator) and up to 10 bytes on 32-bit (11 including the null terminator) are
by default stored inside the class.

Such optimization is completely transparent to the user, the only difference is
that @ref deleter() and @ref release() can't be called on SSO strings, as there
is nothing to delete / release. Presence of SSO on an instance can be queried
using @ref isSmall(). In cases where SSO isn't desired (for example when
storing pointers to string contents stored in a growable array), the string can
be constructed using the @ref AllocatedInit tag (for example with
@ref String(AllocatedInitT, const char*)), which bypasses this optimization and
always allocates.

@attention For consistency with @ref StringView and in order to allow the small
    string optimization, on 32-bit systems the size is limited to 1 GB. That
    should be more than enough for real-world strings (as opposed to arbitrary
    binary data), if you need more please use an @ref Array instead.

@section Containers-String-stl STL compatibility

Instances of @ref String are *implicitly* convertible from and to
@ref std::string if you include @ref Corrade/Containers/StringStl.h. The
conversion is provided in a separate header to avoid unconditional @cpp
#include <string> @ce, which significantly affects compile times. The following
table lists allowed conversions:

Corrade type                    | ↭ | STL type
------------------------------- | - | ---------------------
@ref String                     | ⇆ | @ref std::string

Example:

@snippet Containers-stl.cpp String

Because @ref std::string doesn't provide any way to transfer ownership of its
underlying memory, conversion either way always involves an allocation and a
copy. To mitigate the conversion impact, it's recommended to convert
@ref std::string instances to @ref BasicStringView "StringView" instead where
possible.

        /* Small string optimization. Following size restrictions from
           StringView (which uses the top two bits for marking global and
           null-terminated views), we can use the highest bit to denote a small
           string. The second highest bit is currently unused, as it wouldn't
           make sense to allow a String to be larger than StringView, since
           these are two mutually convertible and interchangeable in many
           cases. In case of a large string, there's size, data pointer and
           deleter pointer, either 24 (or 12) bytes in total. In case of a
           small string, we can store the size only in one byte out of 8 (or
           4), which then gives us 23 (or 11) bytes for storing the actual
           data, excluding the null terminator that's at most 22 / 10 ASCII
           chars. With the two topmost bits reserved, it's still 6 bits left
           for the size, which is more than enough in this case.

           On LE the layout is as follows (bits inside a byte are flipped for
           clarity as well):

            +-------------------------------+---------+
            |             string            | si | 01 |
            |              data             | ze |    |
            |             23B/11B           | 6b | 2b |
            +-------------------+-----+++++++---------+
                                | LSB |||||||   MSB   |
            +---------+---------+-----+++++++---------+
            |  data   |  data   |      size      | 00 |
            | pointer | deleter |                |    |
            |  8B/4B  |  8B/4B  |  56b/24b  | 6b | 2b |
            +---------+---------+-----------+---------+

           On BE it's like this:

            +---------+-------------------------------+
            | 10 | si |             string            |
            |    | ze |              data             |
            | 2b | 6b |             23B/11B           |
            +---------+++++++-----+-------------------+
            |   MSB   ||||||| LSB |
            +---------+++++++-----+---------+---------+
            | 00 |     size       |  data   |  data   |
            |    |                | pointer | deleter |
            | 2b | 6b |  56b/24b  |  8B/4B  |  8B/4B  |
            +---------+-----------+---------+---------+

           I originally tried storing the "small string" bit in the lowest bit
           of the deleter pointer, but function pointers apparently can have
           odd addresses on some platforms as well:

            http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2018-March/121953.html

           The above approach is consistent with StringView, which is the
           preferrable solution after all. */
